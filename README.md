# Health-Hub
Our project is about an health information system where users can find information about the pandemics that have affected humans and to make learning such things more entertaining as just reading can get boring at times. Thus, that was our main focus for the project, to make something where users are not just reading but to be able to interact and play around while learning about the pandemics. The webpage part of the project is mostly focused to be a promotion for the app which is made on Adobe XD.
Users will be able to learn information and interact with the models still but the quiz part will only be on the application. Even though it is only on the app, users can still learn what is the app about on the webpage.

[Design Process]

As a user type, I want to be able to have an interactive menu so that I can easily find the information I need
 - Made the webpage have a menu for the users to get to the part they are most interested of and a simple design so that it does not look too complicated.
   Information of what the users might need are also gathered all in the webpage.
   
As a user type, I want to be able to know what is the webpage about so that I can understand what I am reading
- Gave information on what is the webpage about so users will mnot be lost about what is on the page

Colours of the webpage is muted so that it gives off a serious feel
